    <p>Hi <%= @user.first_name %>!</p>
    <p>
      Just to remind you of the following <%= "issue".pluralize @total_pending_count %>
      that <%= @total_pending_count == 1 ? 'is' : 'are' %>  awaiting your attention.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <%= render 'site/notification_types' %>
    </ul>

    <% if @user_submitted_issue_count > 0 %>
      If you are a ranger for the location of a 'submitted' issue then please check the issue details and 'publish' the issue so that the person who reported it knows you are aware of the problem. Once an issue is published you will no longer receive periodic reminders about it. You may need to apply a label to the ticket before you can publish it. If the ticket is missing vital details that you can't add, you can click the 'revert' button to put it back in a 'draft' state.
    <% end %>

    <% if @old_issue  %>
      <p>
        At least one draft issue is older than two weeks. If you created an issue that you do not wish to publish then deleting it will stop this notification. You will find a delete link at the bottom right of your draft issue page.
      </p>
    <% end %>

    <% if @open_label_counts.keys.include?(:sustrans) || @open_label_counts.keys.include?(:council) %>
      <p>
        <% if @open_label_counts[:sustrans].present? && @open_label_counts[:sustrans] > 0  %>
          Open 'sustrans' issues are those that require Sustrans staff attention.
        <% end %>
        <% if @open_label_counts[:council].present? && @open_label_counts[:council] > 0 %>
          Open 'council' issues are those that require reporting to the council or landowner.
        <% end %>

        If you no longer need to receive notification of these issues

        <% if @open_label_counts[:sustrans].present? && @open_label_counts[:sustrans] > 0  %>
          because you have responded to a comment or informed the relevant body,
        <% end %>

        you can either change the label if it no longer applies or click the 'Start' button on the issue to mark it as 'in progress'.
