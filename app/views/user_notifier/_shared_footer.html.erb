      <b>NB:</b> Comment notifications are still being developed. Please let Chris know at cjreeve@gmail.com if they are annoying. In the future safeguards will be added to prevent people receiving multiple emails, such as if a user deletes and re-submits a comment. An option to allow you to 'unfollow' a conversation will also be added.
